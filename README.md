# Lunar Lander

Pygame implementation of the classical game Lunar Lander.
Runs in fullscreen (Esc to exit).

It's based on https://github.com/pyrex8/lunarlander. Deciphered the code, completely refactored to objects so you can keep your sanity while reading. Also added levels.

## Controls

`Left`, `Right` arrows to fire thrusters, `Space` for vertical thruster. `R` to reset, `Esc` to exit.

## Install and run

Written for Python 3 (my version was 3.7.5). So assuming `python --version` will return something starting with 3.

- install

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- run

`python lunarlander.py`
